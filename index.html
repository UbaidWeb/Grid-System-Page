          <h3>Vinland Saga Season 2 Announced</h3>
          <p>Vinland Saga, the 2019 hit Viking anime, is coming back for a second season. Wit Studios announced the new season on Wednesday and even included a teaser trailer that shows off a few brief snippets from the upcoming episodes.

          Vinland Saga’s first season follows Thorfinn, a young Viking explorer who joins a crew to seek revenge for the death of his father at the hands of Askeladd, the crew’s captain. While the trailer for season 2 doesn’t give much away, it does suggest that Thorfinn may be looking for more than revenge to give meaning to his life after everything that happened last season.</p>
